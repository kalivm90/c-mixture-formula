# c-mixture-formula

This program helps you determine how much of liquid you need to add to another to get a desired strength of another. I made this to help me mix different strengths of "juice" togther. This wasn't anything
other than a C excercise since I have'nt had much practice with C as of late.This program helps you determine how much of one liquid you need to add to another in order to achieve a desired concentration (strength). I created this tool to assist in mixing different strengths of "juice." The units it uses are ml and mg/ml. I don't plan to extend the functionality any further and I doubt many devs will find it useful.

While the primary purpose of this project was practical, it also served as a personal exercise to refresh my skills in C programming, as I hadn't worked with C much recently.
