# C-Mixture-Formula

This simple command line program helps you determine how much of one liquid you need to add to another in order to achieve a desired concentration (strength). The units it uses are ml and mg/ml.

While the primary purpose of this project was practical, it also served as a personal exercise to refresh my skills in C programming, as I hadn't worked with C for some time.

# How to run

`$ make`

`$ ./bin/main`

## Sample data

```
What is the volume per ml and mg/ml of the base? (enter 2 numbers separated by a space):
100 6
Enter the concentration mg/ml of the added liquid? (enter one number):
50
Enter the target concentration mg/mL (enter one number): 18

You need to add approximately 37.50 mL of the 50.00 mg/mL nicotine liquid.
```
